Welcome to my metric converter! Here is a guideline to help you get started:

This program accepts the following conversions:
    Kilometers to meters 
    Kilograms to pounds 
    Meters to feet 
    And vise versa!
    
To receive a conversion your query should be formatting as the following:
    (# of starting unit) startingUnit to endingUnit

For example, "10 ft to m" will yeild and output of 3.05 m
* Note: your query should be formatted using the abbreviation of each unit (i.e., feet -> ft, meters -> m, etc.)

To exit the program, type 'exit' or '-1'
